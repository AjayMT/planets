# planets
A simulation of the gravitational pull between stars and planets.

## Requirements
- Python 2.7
- Pygame 1.9.1

## Usage
Left click to create a star, right click to remove a star.

I usually find that ~15 planets is enough to generate a small star system.

## About
I created this for fun. It isn't very accurate, but it does use the Inverse Square Law.
